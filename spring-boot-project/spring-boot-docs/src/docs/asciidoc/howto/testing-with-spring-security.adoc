Spring Security provides comprehensive integration with Spring MVC Test and this can also be used when testing controllers using the `@WebMvcTest` slice and `MockMvc`.

For additional details on Spring Security's testing support, refer to Spring Security's {spring-security-docs}#test[reference documentation]).
